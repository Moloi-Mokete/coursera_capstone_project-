Johannesburg is the largest city in South Africa and one of the 50 largest urban areas in the world. It is the provincial capital and largest city of Gauteng, which is the wealthiest province in South Africa, this makes Johannesburg attractive for immigrants, investors, and people hoping for a better life. In 1950, the population of Johannesburg was 910,550 and as of 2019, Johannesburg has a population of about 5,635,127. Immigration accounts for a significant 17% of SA\u2019s population growth. For a newcomer to the big city, it can be a daunting task to determine which part of Johannesburg to settle in depending on a person\u2019s preferences. ",

Some of the factors people consider to determine neighborhoods to stay in includes crime rate, schools, healthcare availability, jobs, cost of living, etc. A platform, either mobile application or website, that allows  people to screen suburbs in Johannesburg on the mentioned factors would make a huge difference and save people  time , energy and money that goes into choosing the most favorable  place to settle into.

My solution uses machine learning, clustering in particular, to analyze profiles of suburbs in Johannesburg and categories them. The project considers three factors which are crime rate, school availability and healthcare availability in each suburb. The suburbs are then categorized into three clusters, from best to worst based on crime rate, school availability and healthcare availability.",
